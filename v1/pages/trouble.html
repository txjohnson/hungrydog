            Licking its chops, doggy thinks counter food is pretty good. Doggy goes off to play.

            Later doggy is in trouble! The big kid is in trouble too. Why? It's because there are people food that doggy can't eat. And the big kid left something on the counter. 
            
            If doggy gets into the habit of eating food off the counter, it might he something really bad.

            Being scolded is no fun. Doggy is sad. So is the big kid.
